Provides a single function called fancycut.  The function allows for turning a numeric vector into a factor.  Instead of cut, however, it gives the user more control over how to specify the intervals.  They can be a mix of open/close, close/open, etc.  The function also allows trivial intervals, i.e. points, to be mapped to a factor level.  Additionally, the range of the numeric vector does not all have to be represented in the intervals given.
