fancycut
========

This is a function I wrote as part of a project at work where I needed to cut numeric vectors (in R) but not all my intervals were right or left handed.  Some were point intervals.  There wasn't a really easy way to do this without writing my own function.  Kept it as its own package so I could test pushing something to CRAN.
